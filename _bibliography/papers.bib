	abstract = {We present a data acquisition and visualization pipeline that allows experts to monitor additive manufacturing processes, in particular laser metal deposition with wire (LMD-w) processes, in immersive virtual reality. Our virtual environment consists of a digital shadow of the LMD-w production site enriched with additional measurement data shown on both static as well as handheld virtual displays. Users can explore the production site by enhanced teleportation capabilities that enable them to change their scale as well as their elevation above the ground plane. In an exploratory user study with 22 participants, we demonstrate that our system is generally suitable for the supervision of LMD-w processes while generating low task load and cybersickness. Therefore, it serves as a first promising step towards the successful application of virtual reality technology in the comparatively young field of additive manufacturing.},

	abstract = {Document-level context has received lots of attention for compensating neural machine translation (NMT) of isolated sentences. However, recent advances in document-level NMT focus on sophisticated integration of the context, explaining its improvement with only a few selected examples or targeted test sets. We extensively quantify the causes of improvements by a document-level model in general test sets, clarifying the limit of the usefulness of document-level context in NMT. We show that most of the improvements are not interpretable as utilizing the context. We also show that a minimal encoding is sufÔ¨Åcient for the context modeling and very long context is not helpful for NMT.},
